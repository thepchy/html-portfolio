<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m a content writer turned aspiring developer, currently navigating the exciting (and occasionally mind-bending) world of code.
  For years, I’ve used words to tell stories, shape ideas, and connect with people—but something inside me craved more.
  I wanted to build, not just with imagination, but with logic. That curiosity led me to the world of tech, 
  where creativity meets structure and endless possibilities live behind every semicolon.</p>

<p>I believe our world is increasingly driven by technology—and I want to be someone who not only understands it, but helps shape it.
   So, I’ve rolled up my sleeves and started learning how to code. Every HTML tag, CSS class, and JavaScript function feels like unlocking a new superpower. 
   It’s challenging, yes—but also incredibly rewarding.</p>

<p>This journey isn’t just a career switch. It’s me stepping into a bigger version of myself—someone who blends storytelling with structure, creativity with computation. 
  Whether I end up building websites, apps, or something that hasn’t been invented yet, I’m here for the ride.</p>
